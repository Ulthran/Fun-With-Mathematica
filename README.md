# Fun-With-Mathematica
Just good times and fun stuff

RandomlyGeneratedSierpinskiCarpet.nb

A notebook in which I play around with computer generated fractals. Fun new
terminology like "lost in the sauce" makes an appearance.

Capacitors.nb

A notebook used to do analysis on the results of Lab 02 in my E&M class. Most notable feature is the appearance of linear (or non-linear; same technique works) regression with error included in the data. Some good looking plots and propagation of error made much easier.

Thevenin.nb

Lab 03 where we're looking at more linearization and error propogation but this time on circuits that we are analyzing using Thevenin's Law.

Ampere.nb

Lab 04, more of the same, this is probably the last of these lab notebooks I'll include, unless there is one that is particularly interesting in the future.

Trebuchet.nb

Simulated trebuchet in Mathematica! Yay! Play around with changing parameters (trebuchets have a huge parameter space).

Fractals in Chaos

This notebook is in its own repository but it's worth checking out.

ProjectEuler.nb

A notebook containing a lot of my solutions to PE problems, which I can't post because that would give away the answers
www.projecteuler.net

Lab 05, Lab 06, PS 06, & PS 07.nb

These notebooks are from my nonlinear optoelectronic dynamics course. Some cool analysis of data from an optoelectronic Mackey-Glass feedback loop.
